/**
 * The only constraint for a functional component is to accept props as an argument and return valid JSX.
 *
 * The key thing that makes this type of component different from a class component is the lack of state and lifecycle methods.
 * This is why functional components are also commonly referred to as stateless components.
 *
 * const Hello = ({name}) => <div> Hello {name} </div>
 *
 * This snippet is a contradiction to the most basic rule.
 * If you ever have a class component with only a render method â€“ you should always make it a functional component.
